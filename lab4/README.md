# Lab 4

## Question 1
Write a program that logs whether the given number is even or odd.
> When a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0 then it's an even number. Key to the answer of this question is mod operator '%'.

## Question 2
Write a program to iteration of a string.
> Soltion to this is quick and forward thanks to the inbuilt '.length' property in javascript. And since string in an array of characters we can simply use iteration to achieve desired result.

## Question 3
Implement simple maths calculation using DOM
